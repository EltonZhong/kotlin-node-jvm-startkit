# Delicate
Dive bar on the east side where you at.

## Usage
- Kotlin multiplatform startkit, including js(both node.js and frontend js are OK) and jvm. (It's scalable!)
- Ktor support, okhttp for jvm, and window.fetch for js.(will support node in next release)
- Corotines examples in multiplatform project.

**TODO:**
- Ktor does not support node.js, write engine for it.
